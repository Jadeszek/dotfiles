## what?

My public configuration-files and personal scripts.They might not work for
you, but feel free to steal from them.
I change those files a lot and sometimes I break things, so be careful.

## install

I can't really recommend it, but if you insist you can clone this repo and
install it with

```sh
cd ~
git clone git://github.com/herrblau/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./link.sh l
```

Make sure you have zsh and git installed and in your $PATH.

If you don't want to have the dotfile repo in ~/.dotfiles you'll have to modify
link.sh to point to the correct path.
